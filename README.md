## 🤫 The ```-plist``` option

- Use the -plist option to download movies from a playlist.
- This playlist can be a public playlist created by your own account, or any playlist displayed based on search results or tag filters.
- **You should wrap the playlist URL with " " when you use the -plist option.**

Command Examples:
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/search/JULIA?filters=uncensored-leak&sort=saved" -limit 50 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/search/JULIA?filters=individual&sort=views" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/dm132/actresses/JULIA" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/playlists/ewzoukev" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/dm444/en/labels/WANZ" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/dm21/en/makers/Takara%20Visual" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```
- ```miyuki -plist "https://missav.com/dm1/en/genres/4K" -limit 20 -ffmpeg```

## ⚠️ Precautions

- If you are from an ancient oriental country, you will most likely need a proxy.
- Use ffmpeg to synthesize videos for the best experience.

## 👀 About FFmpeg

1. If you want miyuki to use ffmpeg to process the video, use the -ffmpeg option.
2. Please check whether the ffmpeg command is valid before using the -ffmpeg option. (e.g. ```ffmpeg -version```)
3. To install FFmpeg, please refer to https://ffmpeg.org/
